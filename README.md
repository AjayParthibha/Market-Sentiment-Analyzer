# Stock Sentiment Analytics

A real-time platform that **tracks, classifies, and visualizes market sentiment** around stocks using data from social media, news, and market feeds.  
By combining **real-time data collection, FinBERT-based sentiment analysis, and interactive dashboards**, it reveals how public sentiment correlates with stock price movements and volatility.

## Features
- **Real-Time Data Streams**  
  - Scrapes and aggregates stock mentions from Reddit (r/wallstreetbets, r/investing) and financial news APIs.  
  - Integrates intraday stock price data (via Yahoo Finance or Alpaca).  

- **Sentiment Classification**  
  - Uses **FinBERT** (a transformer model fine-tuned for financial text) to classify posts and headlines as positive, negative, or neutral.  
  - Aggregates scores by ticker and time window for trend tracking.  

- **Interactive Dashboard**  
  - Visualizes sentiment trends alongside stock price and volume data.  
  - Displays trending tickers, sentiment heatmaps, and alerts for significant shifts in market mood.  

- **Extensible Architecture**  
  - Modular codebase for adding new data sources, backtesting sentiment strategies, or deploying trading signals.

## Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, asyncio for streaming)  
- **APIs:** PRAW (Reddit), NewsAPI, yfinance/Alpaca (stock data)  
- **NLP:** Hugging Face Transformers (FinBERT)

- **Visualization:** Streamlit or Plotly Dash  
- **Deployment:** Streamlit Cloud / Docker

```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### 3. Configure API Keys
Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your credentials:

```
NEWS_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key
```

### 4. Start Data Collection
Run the script to collect Reddit posts and news headlines, classify them, and store results:

```
python stream_sentiment.py
```

### 5. Launch the Dashboard
Start the dashboard to visualize live sentiment vs. price trends:

```
streamlit run dashboard.py
```
